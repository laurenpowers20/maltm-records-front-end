# B-Side Music Artist Search Database

## A Fullstack MERN Web App

## Concept

[B-Side Music](https://b-side-music-app.netlify.app/) is here to represent music from artists that need to be heard. Find and search for artists of varying genres and discover songs to add to your collections. Do you have an artist you want represented? We can add them to our expanding list and help get them discovered. Flip your record to the B side and get ready to hear something new.
